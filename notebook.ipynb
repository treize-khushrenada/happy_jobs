End of security nagging.\n",

      "What PLC brand? They vary a lot. Best place to start would be the vendor's documentation. Python has a pymodbus package that can do RTU or TCP messaging. There are packages for OPC UA as well. You should be able to just search them. It doesn't matter how you install Python, just do it your favorite way. If you don't have a favorite way, I'd recommend the official installer for Windows, and whatever is in the distribution's native repository for Linux. Then learn how to work in virtual environments, which is where you'd install your dependencies.\n",
